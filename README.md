# Manhattan Debate

This repository contains my first CS project: I designed and build a website for my high school's debate team to replace the existing one, which [really couldn't have gotten any worse](https://sites.google.com/site/manhattanhighdebate/links).

That being said, as a freshman with no prior knowledge's first foray into coding, this was never launched on account of not being much better.
